# linked list is a way to store data in a list format
# data is stored in a node and these nodes are linked to each other in a sequential manner
# linked list can be more efficient for certain tasks than an array
# there is no indexing, no random access, you cant reach out for an item in the middle of an array
# you have to start at the head of the list and follow the links until you find the node you want or until the end of the list
# removing or adding an item from the middle of a linked list is a lot faster

## operations
# 1. append(to the end of the list)
# 2. append_after
# 3. delete
# 4. find
